## Interpolation
****
Interpolation allows for the forming of strings from any set of variables or constants.

/*:
The compiler recognizes any variables set off with a backslash and surrounded by parenthesis.  Their value is inserted into the string.

/*:
We can get the current date by instantiating an `NSDate` class, part of the `Foundation` framework

This is an example of the Swift language and the legacy NS (NeXTSTEP) classes (many of which are still written in Objective-C) working together.
*/
import Foundation

let date = NSDate()

let dateGreeting = "Hi! The current date is \(date)"    //You may notice the date is not printing in the most readable way (at least in the US).  This could be fixed using a class called NSDateFormatter.

/*:
## Formatted Strings
Occasionally it is necessary to use the `format` method of `String` instead of using interpolation.
*/

//:We format strings by initializing a `String` and calling the `format` method.  Variables are set off with a '%' and the type ('Int` = d, `Double` = f, `String` = s)

//:Formatted strings become useful if we want to display a certain number of digits

let stringWithDigits = String(format: "My double is : %.2f", myDouble)

Try it.  Build a string with 15 digits of pi that looks like "The first 15 digits of pi are 3.14..."

Send the string to the `printPi` function to verify your answer
